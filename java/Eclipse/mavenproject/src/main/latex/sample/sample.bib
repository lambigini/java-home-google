    abstract = {{O}ne of the challenges of ambient systems lies in providing all the available services of the environment to the ambient devices, even if they do not physically host those services. {A}lthough this challenge has come to find a solution through cloud computing, there are still few devices and operating systems that enable applications execution by only uploading the required components into the runtime environment. {T}he {ROCS} ({R}emote {OSG}i {C}aching {S}ervice) framework is a novel proposal which relies on a heavy-weighted standard {J}ava/{OSG}i stack. {I}t is distributed between class servers and ambient devices to provide full functionalities to resource-constrained environments. {T}he {ROCS} framework provides improvements in two areas. {F}irst, it defines a minimal bootstrap environment that runs a standard {J}ava/{OSG}i stack. {S}econdly, it provides an architecture for loading any necessary missing class from remote servers into memory at runtime. {O}ur first results show similar performances when classes are either remotely downloaded into the main memory from a local network or from a flash drive. {T}hese results suggest a way to design minimalistic middleware that dynamically obtain their applications from the network as a first step towards cloud-aware operating systems.},
