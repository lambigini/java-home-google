          </p>
          <p>
            POI 3.11 and later 3.x versions require JDK version 1.6 or later.
          </p>
          <p>
            POI 3.5 to 3.10 required the JDK version 1.5 or later.

            <title>Install Apache Ant</title>
            <p>
                The POI build system requires <a href="https://ant.apache.org/">Apache Ant</a>
                version 1.8 - 1.9.x for Java 1.6 and higher. Newer versions (1.10.x) require Java 8 or higher.
            </p>
            <p>
                The current source code has been tested to work with Ant version 1.9.x and 1.10.x.
            </p>
            <p>
                Remember to set the ANT_HOME environment variable to where Ant was installed/extracted and add
                ANT_HOME/bin to your shell's PATH.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are unsure about the correct value for ANT_HOME, search your file system for "ant.jar".
                This file will be in the directory %ANT_HOME%/lib."  For example, if the path to ant.jar is
                "C:/Programs/Ant/lib/ant.jar", then set ANT_HOME to "C:/Progams/Ant".
            </p>

            <title>Install Apache Forrest</title>
            <p>
                The POI build system requires 
                <a href="https://forrest.apache.org/">Apache Forrest</a> 
                to build the documentation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Specifically the build has been tested to work with Forrest 0.90.
            </p>
	    <p>
	        Remember to set the FORREST_HOME environment variable.

            <title>Working with Eclipse</title>
            <p>
            	Apache POI includes a pre-defined Eclipse project file which can be 
            	used to quickly get set up in the Eclipse IDE. 
            </p>
            <p>
                First make sure that Java is set up properly and that you can execute the 'javac' executable in your shell.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next, open Eclipse and create either a local SVN repository, or a copy of the Git repository,
                and import the project into Eclipse.
            </p>
            <p>
                Right-click on "build.xml", and select "Run As / Ant Build...".  The "Edit Configuration"
                dialog should appear. In the "Targets" tab, select the "Compile" target and click on "Run".
            </p>
            <p>
            	Note: when executing junit tests from within Eclipse, you might need to set the system 
            	property "POI.testdata.path" to the actual location of the 'test-data' directory to make 
            	the test framework find the required test-files. A simple value of 'test-data' usually works. 
            </p>

            <title>Working with IntelliJ Idea</title>
            <p>
                We currently do not offer project files for IntelliJ and unfortunately it
                cannot import the project from the Ant build files.
            </p>
            <p>
                In order to get started, first build Apache POI using Ant as described above
                to get all required 3rd party libraries downloaded.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then import the main folder into a new project and then define all the source folders under src
                accordingly. Also add all libraries from the lib, compile-lib and ooxml-lib folders.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note: when executing junit tests from within IntelliJ, you might need to set the system
                property "POI.testdata.path" to the actual location of the 'test-data' directory to make
                the test framework find the required test-files. A simple value of 'test-data' usually works.

            <title>Using Maven</title>
            <p>Building Apache POI using Maven is not currently officially
             supported, and we strongly suggest continuing to use the official
             Ant build.</p>
            <p>However, including Apache POI within your own Maven project
             is fully supported, and widely used. Please see the
             <a href="site:components">Components Page</a>
             for details of the Maven artifacts available.</p>
